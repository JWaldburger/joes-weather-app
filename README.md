# joes-weather-app
Advanced Java Script Project Two
In this project the idea was to have the user input a zip code.
then  use ajax to access a weather api.
This is a two step process.
The first is the app goes based on the zip code to determine the location via lattitude and longitude cordinants.
The next step is to pull those coordinants from the postal code data using an ajax request.
The follow up to this is, based on the location, make a follow up request to the api to get the near by wind and temperature.
