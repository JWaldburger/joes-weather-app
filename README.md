# joes-weather-app
Advanced Java Script Project Two. In this project, the idea was to have the user input a zip code. then use ajax to access a weather API. This is a two-step process. The first is the app goes based on the zip code to determine the location via latitude and longitude coordinates. The next step is to pull those coordinates from the postal code data using an ajax request. The follow up to this is, based on the location, make a follow-up request to the API to get nearby wind and temperature.
